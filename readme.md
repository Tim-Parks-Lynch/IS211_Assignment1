# Introduction

Hello Professor,

My name is Tim and I took a python class along time ago (like Python 2.3 days). That being said I did a coding bootcamp for javascript including (node.js, react, express, and databases). You might find that some of my code is a little weird because of that. If that is the case could you point that out to me? I want to follow the recommended standards for python development. 

# My Environment

I'm using VSCode to develop on a Mac, so if you find that the file paths are messed up for your computer please let me know (or if you know a trick around that with code, please let me know). 

# Questions regarding this assignment

Assignment 1
1. How would you define a List Divide Exception class and make sure it worked correctly? Do I need to derive it from the exception class built into python?.
2. What is the correct way to call it. I used a try/exception in the first assignment, but wasn't exactly sure I did it correctly.

Assignment 2:

None, I'm pretty well versed with classes in JS and was able to understand what I saw.

# Overall

If there is anything that looks weird, or that you think could be better please let me know. Appreciate all that you do. 

Thanks,

Tim
